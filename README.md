Efficient Access Tracking with Swift Macros

This solution enables tracking access of read and write operations on properties using Swift macros. By leveraging Swiftâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities, properties are automatically converted into a copy-on-write mechanism, ensuring efficient memory management and preventing unintended mutations. This approach enhances performance while maintaining a clear audit trail of property access patterns.
